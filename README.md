Swift - Digital Clock App

App created in Xcode 10.1 (10B61) using Swift 4.2 and tested on a iPhone X Emulator

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Digital Clock App' icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a Large Time stamp of a working digital clock in the middle of their iPhone device. 
The numbers are in a white color with a black background. On the bottom is a light grey button with the text
"Show Settings" marked on it. When the user clicks the button a new small view shows up under the time stamp.

The user is given 3 different options.<br>
1. Change the Clock Color: White, Black, Red or Green using a segmented control.<br>
2. Change the Background Color: Black, White, Yellow or Blue using a segmented control.<br>
3. Change the Background Image: Clouds, Wood, Space or a Sunset using segmented controls.<br>

As the user clicks the various controls they will see the changes immediately.
Also, when the settings view is shown the button on the bottom is more prominent and is now labeled "Hide Settings". 
When the user is done with their changes they can now click the "Hide Settings" button and the settings view control will 
be hidden from view with the customized view now displayed.

Its nice to have a custom digital clock you can set up on your phone to use.
